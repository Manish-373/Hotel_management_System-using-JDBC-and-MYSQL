# **Hotel Management System using JDBC and MySQL**

The **Hotel Reservation System** is a Java-based application designed to manage hotel bookings efficiently by connecting with a **MySQL database**. It provides functionalities to **reserve rooms, view reservations, retrieve room numbers, update reservations, and delete reservations**. This system is **console-based** and demonstrates **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations using **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**.

---

## **Key Highlights**

* Built using **Java SE**
* Database: **MySQL**
* Supports **auto-incremented reservation IDs**
* Uses both **Statement** and **PreparedStatement** for database operations
* Ensures user-friendly interaction with **menu-driven operations**

---

## **2. Prerequisite**

### **Technical Knowledge**

* Java Programming (OOP concepts, Exception Handling, Loops, Conditionals)
* JDBC for database connectivity
* SQL (DDL, DML operations)
* Basic understanding of CRUD operations

### **Software/Tools**

* **JDK 8 or above**
* **MySQL Server (8.0 recommended)**
* **MySQL Workbench** or **Command Line Client**
* **IDE/Text Editor** (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
* **MySQL Connector/J (JDBC Driver)**

---

## **3. SQL Database Setup**

### **Step 1: Create Database**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Hotel_db;
USE Hotel_db;
```

### **Step 2: Create Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservation (
    Reservation_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Guest_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Room_number INT NOT NULL,
    Contact_number VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    Reservation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## **4. Uses / Applications**

The **Hotel Reservation System** can be used in:

### **Small and Medium Hotels**

* To maintain and track customer bookings
* Manage room availability

### **Travel Agencies**

* Manage hotel reservations on behalf of clients

### **Learning & Academic Projects**

* Ideal for demonstrating CRUD operations with JDBC
* Helps students understand database connectivity with Java

### **Future Enhancements**

* Adding a **graphical user interface (JavaFX or Swing)**
* Online reservation portal with **payment integration**
* Multi-user login system (**admin, receptionist, customer**)
